# TextRenderer Technical Assessment

## Current Implementation

The `TextRenderer` class is designed to render text using a sprite sheet/font atlas approach, which aligns perfectly with how a device like the Digivice would display text. This approach has several advantages:

1. **Memory Efficient**: Only one texture is needed containing all font characters
2. **Performance**: Simple texture copying operations instead of complex font rendering
3. **Authenticity**: Maintains the pixelated, fixed-font look of the original device 

## Current Issues

After analyzing the provided code, several implementation issues are preventing successful compilation:

1. **Static vs Instance Member Confusion**: 
   - The `drawText()` implementation is accessing instance members (`fontTexture_`, `defaultKerning_`) without a proper object instance
   - Calls to `getCharRect()` are being made without an object instance
   
2. **Incomplete Implementation**: 
   - Some code blocks are marked with ellipses (`{...}`) indicating incomplete implementation
   - The JSON loading logic appears incomplete when processing frames

3. **Method Signature Mismatch**: 
   - The error suggests a possible mismatch between the method declaration in the header and the implementation

## Impact

These issues prevent successful compilation of the TextRenderer class, which in turn affects any part of the application that needs to display text, including menu systems, status displays, and other UI elements.

## Technical Approach

The recommended approach is to correct the implementation issues without changing the fundamental sprite-based text rendering approach. We should:

1. Fix the method implementations to properly use instance members
2. Complete the JSON parsing logic to properly load character mapping data
3. Ensure method signatures in the implementation match the declarations

This will preserve the intended behavior of using a pre-rendered font atlas, which is appropriate for a Digivice emulator project.
