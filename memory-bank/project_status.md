# Project Status

## Current Status

The DigiviceRefactor project is a C++ application simulating a Digivice device using SDL2 and SDL2_image. The project is currently in a stable state with a functioning state-based architecture and successfully builds with no errors.

### Working Components
- Basic game loop structure
- State management system with transitions
- Asset loading framework
- Input handling
- Display management with SDL2
- Text rendering system using sprite-based font atlas
- Multiple game states (Adventure, Menu)
- Digimon character animations with idle and walk cycles
- Background environment rendering

### Areas for Enhancement
- Missing menu cursor texture
- Error handling consistency
- Configuration management
- Memory optimization for assets
- UI system capabilities

## Build Status

The project currently builds successfully with no errors or warnings. The application runs correctly and demonstrates core functionality.

### Minor Runtime Warnings
- Missing texture warning: `WARN: Texture 'menu_cursor' not found in AssetManager`

## Development Roadmap

### Immediate Actions (Current Sprint)
1. Fix TextRenderer implementation issues
2. Investigate OverworldMapState references
3. Address size conversion warnings

### Near-Term Goals (Next 1-2 Sprints)
1. Implement proper error handling
2. Create centralized configuration system
3. Optimize asset management

### Long-Term Vision
1. Enhanced input system
2. Improved asset pipeline
3. Performance optimization
4. Quality improvements (testing, documentation)

## Risk Assessment

### High Priority Risks
- **Build Stability**: Current compilation errors prevent testing and further development
- **Memory Management**: Potential for memory leaks and inefficient resource usage

### Medium Priority Risks
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling could lead to crashes or unexpected behavior
- **Configuration**: Hard-coded values make changes difficult and error-prone

### Low Priority Risks
- **Code Organization**: Multiple workspace files and inconsistent naming conventions
- **Documentation**: Limited code documentation for future developers
