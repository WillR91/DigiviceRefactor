# DigiviceRefactor Progress Update

## Current Progress

### TextRenderer Implementation Fix
1. Identified issues with the TextRenderer class implementation:
   - Incorrect member access patterns in `drawText` method
   - Improper method calls to `getCharRect`
   - Type casting issues
   
2. Fixed implementation:
   - Removed unnecessary `this->` qualifiers that were causing issues
   - Fixed method access patterns to match class declaration
   - Ensured consistent method signatures between header and implementation

### OverworldMapState Investigation
1. Unable to locate the OverworldMapState.cpp file in the project structure
2. The file may be:
   - Planned for future development but not yet created
   - Located in a different directory or under a different name
   - A legacy reference to code that has been removed or renamed

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Verify TextRenderer Fix**
   - Build the project to confirm compilation errors are resolved
   - Test the text rendering functionality in the application
   - Document any additional issues discovered

2. **Address OverworldMapState Issues**
   - Determine if this is a planned feature or an existing component
   - If it exists elsewhere, locate and fix the syntax errors
   - If it's a planned feature, create a placeholder with proper structure

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Update architecture documentation with details on the text rendering system
   - Document the error patterns found to prevent similar issues in the future
   - Create a more detailed component list for the UI system

## Technical Observations

1. **Code Organization**
   - There's inconsistency in class design patterns across components
   - Consider standardizing access patterns and method calling conventions

2. **Error Handling**
   - The TextRenderer has good error logging, but could use more robust input validation
   - Consider adding a debug rendering mode to visualize text boundaries and position

3. **Asset Management**
   - The font texture loading is external to TextRenderer (asset manager responsibility)
   - This separation is good for memory management but requires careful coordination

## Going Forward

1. **Architectural Improvements**
   - Consider creating a more formal UI component system
   - Develop a text styling system for different text appearances
   - Add support for different fonts and dynamic font loading

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Develop unit tests for the TextRenderer to ensure it works in all scenarios
   - Create a visual test harness for UI components

3. **Documentation**
   - Create more detailed class diagrams for the UI system
   - Document text rendering best practices for the project
