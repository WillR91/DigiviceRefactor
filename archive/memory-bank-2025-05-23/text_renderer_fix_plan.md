# TextRenderer Fix Action Plan

## Issues Identified

After careful inspection of the TextRenderer implementation and error messages, I've identified these specific issues:

1. **Line 172-173**: The `drawText` method is correctly declared as a member function but is accessing members incorrectly.
   - Error: "illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::fontTexture_'"
   
2. **Line 174**: Incorrect cast causing type error
   - Error: "cannot convert from 'unknown' to 'void *'"
   
3. **Lines 180**: Illegal reference to defaultKerning_ member
   - Error: "illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::defaultKerning_'"
   - Error: "non-standard syntax; use '&' to create a pointer to member"
   
4. **Lines 189, 192**: Calls to getCharRect without object reference
   - Error: "a call of a non-static member function requires an object"

## Fix Approach

1. **Method Implementation Correction**:
   - The `drawText` implementation needs to match the declaration in the header exactly
   - Declaration in header: `void drawText(SDL_Renderer* renderer, const std::string& text, int x, int y, float scale = 1.0f, int kerning = -1) const;`
   - Implementation must match this signature precisely

2. **Member Access Pattern**:
   - Since the method is declared as a member function with the `const` qualifier, it must access class members using `this->` or direct member access
   - Example: `this->fontTexture_` or simply `fontTexture_`

3. **Method Call Patterns**:
   - Calls to `getCharRect` need to be made on the object instance
   - Since we're in a member function, use `this->getCharRect()` or just `getCharRect()`

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Ensure proper pointer casting with appropriate cast operators

## Implementation Plan

1. Carefully inspect the method declaration and implementation signature
2. Fix each error one by one, ensuring proper access patterns
3. Test the changes to verify TextRenderer functionality

## Post-Fix Validation

1. Ensure TextRenderer compiles without errors
2. Test basic text rendering functionality
3. Document the changes and lessons learned for future reference
