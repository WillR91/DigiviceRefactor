# TextRenderer Implementation Plan

## Objective
Fix the implementation of the TextRenderer class to properly render text using the sprite sheet/font atlas approach, resolving all compiler errors while maintaining the original design intent.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Fix the `drawText()` Method
The primary errors occur in this method, which is trying to access instance members incorrectly:

- Fix how member variables are accessed (ensuring proper instance access)
- Correct the method signature to match the declaration in the header
- Complete the implementation for space characters, character width calculation, and rendering

### 2. Complete the `loadFontData()` Method
The JSON parsing is incomplete, specifically:

- Complete the frame processing loop to properly extract character rectangle data
- Add proper error checking and logging
- Ensure the character map is properly populated

### 3. Complete the `getCharRect()` Method
This helper method needs proper implementation:

- Return the correct SDL_Rect for a given character
- Add proper bounds and validation checking
- Handle special cases (unknown characters, spaces, etc.)

### 4. Review and Complete `getTextDimensions()`
Ensure this method correctly calculates text dimensions:

- Complete the implementation for space characters
- Correctly handle first character vs subsequent characters
- Ensure width and height calculations are accurate

## Testing Approach

After implementation, we will test the TextRenderer with:

1. **Basic Rendering Test**: Render simple strings to verify character placement
2. **Special Character Test**: Test spaces and characters at edges of the atlas
3. **Kerning Test**: Verify that character spacing works correctly
4. **Error Cases**: Test behavior with missing characters, null texture, etc.

## Success Criteria

- TextRenderer compiles without errors
- Text is rendered correctly using the sprite atlas
- Character spacing and positioning is visually consistent
- No memory leaks or runtime errors occur during text rendering

## Timeline
- Implementation: 1 day
- Testing: 1/2 day
- Documentation: 1/2 day
