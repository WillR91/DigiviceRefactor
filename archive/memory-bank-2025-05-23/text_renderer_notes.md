# TextRenderer Technical Notes

## Current Implementation Issues

The TextRenderer class has several implementation issues that prevent it from compiling:

1. **Static vs Non-static Method Confusion**
   - The `drawText` method implementation in TextRenderer.cpp is attempting to access instance members (`fontTexture_`, `defaultKerning_`) but is implemented incorrectly.
   - The error "overloaded member function not found" suggests a signature mismatch between header and implementation.

2. **Member Access Issues**
   - Error: "illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::fontTexture_'"
   - Error: "illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::defaultKerning_'"
   - These suggest the method is either:
     - Being implemented as static when it should be non-static
     - Or accessing instance variables incorrectly

3. **Method Call Patterns**
   - Error: 'TextRenderer::getCharRect': a call of a non-static member function requires an object
   - This indicates that instance methods are being called without an object reference

## Resolution Approach

1. **Method Signature Verification**
   - Ensure implementation signature matches the declaration in the header
   - Check parameter types and return types

2. **Instance vs Static Correction**
   - Verify that instance methods are properly implemented with instance member access
   - Check for any implicit static implementations

3. **Type Safety**
   - Address the type cast error: 'cannot convert from 'unknown' to 'void*''
   - Ensure proper pointer handling and type safety

## Testing Plan

After fixing the implementation:

1. Create a simple test case to render text using the TextRenderer
2. Verify functionality with various text inputs
3. Test edge cases like empty strings, special characters, etc.

## Long-term Improvements

Consider these improvements after fixing the immediate issues:

1. Add proper error handling to the TextRenderer methods
2. Consider implementing text caching for frequently used strings
3. Add support for text alignment options (left, center, right)
4. Consider implementing text styles (bold, italic, etc.)
