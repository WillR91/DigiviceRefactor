# Current Technical Assessment - May 10, 2025

## Project Status Summary
The DigiviceRefactor project is currently in a stable, buildable state. The most recent build compiles successfully without errors and the application runs properly, demonstrating core functionality.

## Recent Discoveries
- There are no current build errors in the project
- The OverworldMapState referenced in previous documentation does not exist in the current codebase
- TextRenderer class appears to be properly implemented and functional
- The game successfully transitions between states, particularly the AdventureState and MenuState

## Observed Issues
- A minor warning about missing cursor texture: `WARN: Texture 'menu_cursor' not found in AssetManager.`
  - This is expected behavior as the carousel-style menu doesn't actually use a cursor
  - The code attempts to load the texture but has no rendering implementation for it
- Various memory-bank documents reference issues that have been resolved or don't exist in the current code version
- The MenuState class has code for handling a cursor but doesn't fully implement its usage

## Technical Architecture
The application demonstrates a well-structured architecture with:
- A state management system that handles transitions between game states
- An asset management system that loads and provides textures
- A text rendering system that uses a sprite font atlas
- An animation system for character sprites

## Immediate Focus Areas
1. Clean up memory-bank documentation to reflect the current state of the project
2. Enhance the menu system by:
   - Making cursor texture optional for carousel menus
   - Adding menu style types to differentiate rendering approaches
   - Preparing for node-based map navigation system
3. Review code for potential improvements or optimizations
4. Plan for new feature development based on current capabilities

## Build Environment
- Successfully builds with CMake
- Executes properly on Windows
- No current compiler errors or warnings affecting functionality
