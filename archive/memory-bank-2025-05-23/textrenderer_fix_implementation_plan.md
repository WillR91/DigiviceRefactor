# TextRenderer Fix Plan

## Issue Analysis

After examining the TextRenderer code and build errors, I've identified these specific issues:

### 1. Method Implementation Issues
- **Error**: `C2511: 'void TextRenderer::drawText(SDL_Renderer *,const std::string &,int,int,float,int) const': overloaded member function not found in 'TextRenderer'`
- **Cause**: There appears to be a mismatch between the method declaration in the header and the implementation. The header declares:
  ```cpp
  void drawText(SDL_Renderer* renderer, const std::string& text, int x, int y, float scale = 1.0f, int kerning = -1) const;
  ```
  But there might be an issue with how it's implemented.

### 2. Member Access Issues
- **Error**: `C2597: illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::fontTexture_'`
- **Error**: `C2597: illegal reference to non-static member 'TextRenderer::defaultKerning_'`
- **Cause**: The implementation is trying to access instance members incorrectly, as if they were static members.

### 3. Method Call Issues
- **Error**: `C2352: 'TextRenderer::getCharRect': a call of a non-static member function requires an object`
- **Cause**: The code is calling the `getCharRect()` member function without an object instance.

### 4. Type Casting Issue
- **Error**: `C2440: 'type cast': cannot convert from 'unknown' to 'void *'`
- **Cause**: Improper type casting in the implementation.

## Fix Approach

### 1. Ensure Method Declaration and Implementation Match
- Check that the `drawText` implementation in TextRenderer.cpp exactly matches the declaration in TextRenderer.h
- Verify that the method is properly defined as a class member function

### 2. Fix Member Access Patterns
- Use proper instance member access (`this->fontTexture_` or just `fontTexture_`)
- Ensure all member variable access follows instance access patterns

### 3. Fix Method Calls
- Ensure calls to `getCharRect()` are made on the object instance
- Since we're in a member function, use `this->getCharRect()` or just `getCharRect()`

### 4. Fix Type Casting
- Use proper C++ casting operators (`static_cast<T>()`, `reinterpret_cast<T>()`, etc.)
- Ensure type safety in all conversions

## Implementation Plan

1. **Step 1: Review Existing Code**
   - Compare TextRenderer.h declaration with TextRenderer.cpp implementation
   - Identify specific lines where errors occur

2. **Step 2: Fix Implementation Issues**
   - Correct the `drawText` method implementation
   - Fix member access patterns
   - Correct method calls
   - Address type casting issues

3. **Step 3: Test Compilation**
   - Attempt to build the project
   - Address any additional errors that arise

4. **Step 4: Test Functionality**
   - Ensure text rendering works as expected
   - Verify that character mappings are correctly loaded and applied

## Validation Criteria

- Project builds without TextRenderer-related errors
- Text renders correctly in the application
- No regressions in existing functionality
