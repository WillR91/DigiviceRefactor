# Text Rendering Approach

## Current Implementation

The DigiviceRefactor project uses a sprite sheet-based approach for text rendering, which is consistent with how the original Digivice hardware handled text display. This approach has the following characteristics:

### Font Atlas Method

1. **Sprite Sheet Font Atlas**:
   - Characters are stored as pre-rendered sprites in a font texture atlas
   - Each character has a fixed position in the atlas defined in a JSON mapping file
   - The TextRenderer class loads this mapping during initialization

2. **Limited Character Set**:
   - Only contains characters that are needed for the application
   - No dynamic font rendering or text styling
   - Consistent with the original device's capabilities

3. **Rendering Process**:
   - Characters are drawn by copying the appropriate rectangle from the font atlas
   - Spacing between characters is controlled by a kerning parameter
   - Scale parameter allows for size adjustments

4. **TextRenderer Implementation**:
   - Maintains a map from characters to their source rectangles in the atlas
   - Provides methods to draw text and calculate text dimensions
   - Non-owning reference to texture managed by AssetManager

## Design Considerations

1. **Authenticity to Original Hardware**:
   - The original Digivice had limited display capabilities with fixed character sets
   - Using pre-rendered sprites maintains this authentic look and feel

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Pre-rendered font atlas is more efficient for limited hardware
   - No need for complex font rendering libraries
   - Reduced memory usage compared to full font libraries

3. **Simplicity**:
   - Direct mapping from character to sprite position
   - No complex text layout algorithms required
   - Easier to maintain and debug

## Future Enhancements

While maintaining the sprite sheet approach, potential improvements could include:

1. **Multiple Font Support**:
   - Additional font atlases for different text styles
   - Selection mechanism for choosing the appropriate font

2. **Extended Character Set**:
   - Support for additional characters as needed
   - Possibly multiple language support

3. **Layout Improvements**:
   - Text alignment options (center, right-align)
   - Word wrapping capabilities
   - Text boxes with auto-sizing

4. **Optimization**:
   - Batch rendering of text for improved performance
   - Caching of commonly used text
