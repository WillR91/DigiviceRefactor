# Fix Implementation Plan

## Priority 1: TextRenderer Implementation Issues

### Problem
The TextRenderer class has critical implementation issues in the `drawText` method and other member functions that prevent the project from compiling. The main issues are:

1. Incorrect member function implementation 
2. Improper access to class members
3. Static vs non-static method confusion
4. Type casting issues

### Solution Approach
1. **Method Signature Matching**
   - Ensure the implementation signature matches the declaration in the header
   - Fix the `drawText` method to correctly implement the declared interface

2. **Member Access Pattern**
   - Use proper member access syntax within methods (`this->` or direct member access)
   - Fix calls to `getCharRect` and other member functions to use the object instance properly

3. **Type Safety**
   - Address any type casting issues with appropriate C++ cast operators
   - Ensure pointer handling is done correctly

### Implementation Steps
1. Fix the `drawText` method implementation in TextRenderer.cpp
2. Address member access in the method body
3. Fix calls to `getCharRect` within the class
4. Test the TextRenderer class with basic text rendering

### Testing
1. Ensure TextRenderer compiles without errors
2. Create a test case to render text using TextRenderer
3. Validate text appearance and dimensions

## Priority 2: OverworldMapState Syntax Errors

### Problem
There are syntax errors in the OverworldMapState.cpp file, including:
- Missing semicolons
- Brace mismatches
- Invalid function declarations

### Solution Approach
1. **Locate the File**
   - Determine if the file exists in another location or under a different name
   - Check if it's a planned feature not yet fully implemented

2. **If File Exists**
   - Fix the syntax errors
   - Validate function declarations
   - Ensure it integrates with the state system properly

3. **If File Doesn't Exist**
   - Determine if we should create it based on project requirements
   - Create a placeholder with proper structure if needed
   - Document the state's purpose and integration

## Future Enhancements
After fixing the critical issues:

1. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Add proper error checking for all TextRenderer methods
   - Implement bounds checking and parameter validation
   - Consider performance improvements for text rendering

2. **Architecture Documentation**
   - Document the fixed components in detail
   - Update the architectural documentation with lessons learned
   - Create guidelines to prevent similar issues in the future

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Create a proper testing framework for UI components
   - Add unit tests for TextRenderer functionality
   - Create integration tests for state transitions
