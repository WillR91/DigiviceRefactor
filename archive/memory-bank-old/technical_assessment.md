# Technical Assessment

## Architectural Decisions

### Strengths
1. **State Pattern Implementation**
   - Well-structured state management with GameState base class and derived states
   - Clear state transitions with fade effects
   - The state stack approach provides flexibility for UI overlays and state history

2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns between Game, AssetManager, InputManager, and Display classes
   - Each component has a single responsibility, following SOLID principles

3. **Memory Management**
   - Use of smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`) for state management
   - Proper cleanup in destructors

4. **Cross-Platform Foundation**
   - PCDisplay abstraction could serve as a base for platform-specific implementations
   - Core game logic is separate from platform-specific code

5. **Asset Loading System**
   - AssetManager provides centralized resource management
   - Proper texture loading and management

### Areas Needing Attention

1. **Error Handling**
   - Many initialization functions return boolean success/failure without detailed error information
   - Limited exception handling throughout the codebase
   - SDL_Log is used inconsistently for error reporting

2. **Configuration Management**
   - Hard-coded values in multiple locations (screen dimensions, file paths, etc.)
   - No central configuration system or settings file

3. **Memory Usage Optimization**
   - Asset loading appears to load all assets at once rather than on-demand
   - No texture atlas implementation for sprite batching

4. **Input System Rigidity**
   - Input handling is tightly coupled to specific key bindings
   - No support for input remapping or different control schemes

5. **Game State Architecture**
   - The state transition system is complex and could lead to edge cases
   - Lack of comprehensive state transition validation

## Technical Debt

1. **Code Organization**
   - Multiple workspace files suggest branches or work-in-progress features
   - Inconsistent file naming conventions (some camelCase, some snake_case)

2. **Build System**
   - Hard-coded library paths in CMakeLists.txt
   - Manual SDL2_image inclusion vs. proper find_package()
   - No package management for dependencies

3. **Asset Pipeline**
   - Manual sprite conversion processes with Python scripts
   - No automated asset optimization or compression

4. **Testing**
   - No visible unit testing or integration testing framework
   - Manual validation of game behavior

5. **Documentation**
   - Limited inline documentation
   - No API documentation or developer guidelines

## Future Development Considerations

1. **Game Loop Optimization**
   - Consider implementing a fixed timestep game loop for consistent physics
   - Add frame rate limiting and VSync options

2. **Asset Loading Improvements**
   - Implement progressive or on-demand asset loading
   - Add asset caching and unloading for memory management

3. **Input System Enhancement**
   - Design a more flexible input mapping system
   - Add controller and touch support

4. **Configuration System**
   - Implement a JSON/XML based configuration system
   - Add user settings persistence

5. **Quality of Life Improvements**
   - Add automated testing
   - Improve error reporting and logging
   - Create development documentation

## Known Bugs/Issues

1. **Potential memory leaks** in texture management if shutdown order is incorrect
2. **Possible race conditions** during state transitions
3. **Error handling gaps** in asset loading process
4. **Font rendering complexity** - Text rendering uses sprite sheets and font atlas approach rather than dynamic font rendering
5. **Inconsistent method signatures** - Potential mismatches between header declarations and implementation files in some areas of the codebase
